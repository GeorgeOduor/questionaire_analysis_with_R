This is a simple questionaire analysis with R code.I have been doing quite a number with SPSS but I came to realize the power and simplicity in doing the same with R.This code should be taken just for a guide.

Anyone can download this file and look at it.Any additions and subtractions are alowed.

Libraries used for this project include,

"dplyr","ggplot2","reshape2"
